## JOHI study:
Our first study looked at the microbiome composition of 54 fecal samples using 16S rRNA gene amplcion sequencing. Additionally, the microbiota composition was confirmed and the functional profile assessed using 15 samples sent for shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

The following files are included in this folder:
- The DADA2 code for primer set 1 and primer set 2 data (DADA2.Rmd)
- The analysis of the primer set 1 and primer set 2 (Primer_set1/2_analysis.Rmd)
- The preprocessing commands of the shotgun metagenomic sequencing data (Shotgun_metagenomic_preprocessing.sh)
- The analysis of the shotgun metagenomic data, including taxonomic, functional and resistome analysis (Shotgun_metagenomic_Analysis.Rmd)
- A comparison analysis of the different sequencing strategies and txonomic profiling tools used in the study (Primer_Sets_16S_comparison.Rmd)
